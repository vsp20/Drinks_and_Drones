### Front end startup instructuions
To run the front-end locally, navigate to admin-on-rest-demo-master folder and run `npm install` which will install all the necessary files and libraries. 

Once this is done you can simply just run `npm start` and the server should just boot up and defaults to port 3000 on local host. (`localhost:3000`).

Since there were some difficulties in connecting the database, currently there are built in credentials to navigate the site. Using `demo` as both the username and password should gain you entry into the site. 

### Backend Startup instructions
To run the backend you must use `pip3 install <package-name>` for all the imports necessary in the `run.py` file. Once this is done, you can run the server by using the command `python3 run.py`. The server should run on port number `35230`
